# Data Analysis Projects with Python

This repository showcases a collection of data analysis and machine learning projects, focused on enhancing my practical skills in Python, Pandas, and other analytical tools. Throughout these projects, I aim to demonstrate proficiency in key techniques such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and artificial intelligence, applying them to real-world problems to generate insights and solutions.

## Key Focus Areas

### Exploratory and Statistical Analysis
- Data cleaning and handling of missing values.  
- Descriptive and inferential analysis.  
- Analysis of data distributions and pattern identification.  

### Machine Learning
- Building predictive models using Scikit-learn.  
- Experimenting with supervised and unsupervised algorithms.  
- Model evaluation and optimization.  

### Data Distribution and Visualization
- Creating statistical charts and visualizations to explore patterns and data distributions.  
- Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and more for EDA.  

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Main programming language used in the projects.  
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries for creating charts and visualizations.  
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.  
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Development environment used to build, test, and document the projects.
